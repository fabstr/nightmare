The rooms should have an object layer called "objects" in which there is 
at least one key and one carpet. The carpet should have a property "target"
with a room file (eg "room0.tmx") or "EXIT" as value. When the player walks
in EXIT, the level is passed.

The key and the carpet MUST be called "key" and "carpet".

If there are multiple carpets, the exit carpet is called "carpet" and the rest are called "carpet-0", "carpet-1" and so on.
